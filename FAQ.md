Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I see a lightning bolt in the upper right corner.  What is it for?
-------------
The lighting bolt comes from the kernel for the pi. It's telling you that it is currently being underpowered.
Make sure you have a good power supply and USB cable to power your pi. 2.5A is recommended for the raspberry pi 3.

Why should I purchase an 800x480 resolution screen instead of a higher resolution 1024x600 screen?
------------
Android Auto only supports a few fixed resolutions, of which 600p is not an option.  A scaled 480p video stream from
the phone will look worse on a 600p screen because 600 is not an integer multiple of 480.  The known supported resolutions
of Android Auto are as follows:
- 480p
- 720p (requires dev mode enabled)
- 1080p (requires dev mode enabled)

I want to run this on an Android tablet...
