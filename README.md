_Poor man's Android Auto distribution_

Transform your Raspberry Pi to an Android Auto head unit, powered by [OpenAuto](https://github.com/f1xpl/openauto) and [aasdk](https://github.com/f1xpl/aasdk).

This is the source code repository, just in case you want to build the system yourself. The [ready-to-use image is actually located here](https://www.tnhh.net/crankshaft.html). This will eventually be filled with instructions how to build the system yourself. For now, it's understandably quite empty.

To file a bug or an enhancement idea, please file an issue on this repository. For bugs or ideas related to OpenAuto or aasdk, please go to f1xpl's corresponding repository to file a bug report.
